## What is VT-CLI
**VT-CLI** is a [VirusTotal] command-line interface script where
you can scan/analyze suspicious links and files, developed for practice and personal use. 

the script is written based on the [vt-py] library presented by Virus Total themselves 
as the main dependency to interact with [VirusTotal REST API v3].


## Installation

- Clone the repository:
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/0xRar/VT-CLI.git
    ```

- Install the dependencies:
    ```
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


> ‚ö†Ô∏èTo run the script you're going to need a virustotal account so you can get 
your api key: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/my-apikey


- And for the final step add your virustotal api key in `config/.env`:
    ```
    VT_TOKEN=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```
